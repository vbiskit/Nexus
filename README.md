## About  

I developed **Nexus** to streamline username searches and improve efficiency for both myself and others. Many existing tools are either too slow or lack accuracy, so I built Nexus to provide **faster, more reliable results**. With its optimized performance and integration with **DuckDuckGo search**, Nexus offers a **powerful, privacy-conscious** solution for finding usernames with **speed and precision**.  

### About This Tool  
 **Faster Than Other Tools** (Whatsmyname.app and Blackbird)  
 **DuckDuckGo Search For More Hidden Links**  
 **Lightweight And Easy To Use**
