## About  

I created Nexus to make my work easier and to help others save time when searching for usernames. Many existing tools are either too slow or lack efficiency, so I built Nexus to deliver faster and more reliable results. By outperforming other tools and integrating DuckDuckGo search, Nexus provides a powerful and privacy-friendly way to find usernames with speed and accuracy. 

### About This Tool  
 **Faster Than Other Tools** (Whatsmyname.app and Blackbird)  
 **DuckDuckGo Search For More Hidden Links**  
 **Lightweight And Easy To Use**
