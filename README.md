## About  
![Screenshot](2.png)
I created userfinder to make my work easier and to help others save time when searching for usernames. Many existing tools are either too slow or lack efficiency, so I built userfinder to deliver faster and more reliable results. By outperforming other tools and integrating DuckDuckGo search, userfinder provides a powerful and privacy-friendly way to find usernames or first name and last names with speed and accuracy.
