# I created Nexus to make my work easier and to help others save time when searching for usernames. Many existing tools are either too slow or lack efficiency, so I built Nexus to deliver faster and more reliable results. By outperforming other tools and integrating DuckDuckGo search, Nexus provides a powerful and privacy-friendly way to find usernames with speed and accuracy.
